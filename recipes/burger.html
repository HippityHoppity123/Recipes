    <h3 class = "big">How to make: </h3>
    <h3>How to make meat patties: </h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Use Ground Chuck Beef (80/20): </strong>grind your own or buy it ground, but 20% fat is ideal and keep it refrigerated until you’re ready to use it.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overwork your meat: </strong>this will make it tough and dense</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the patties: </strong>1” wider than the bun since they shrink on the grill.</li>
        <li><strong>Make an indentation: </strong>in the center to prevent it from plumping up in the center.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't season too early: </strong>Salt changes the structure of proteins and toughens burgers so don’t season your ground beef until you have formed your patties and are ready to grill.</li>
        <li><strong>Get a good sear: </strong>Once on the grill, let patties brown and sear well (3-5 min) before flipping, and do not press down on the burger save that for making Smash Burgers.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>How to assemble burger: </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Apply a generous amount of sauce to both buns (see below for our favorite burger sauces).</li>
        <li>Place pickles, lettuce, tomatoes, and red onion onto the bottom bun</li>
        <li>Place cheesy burger patty over the veggies and cover with top bun</li>
    </ol>
